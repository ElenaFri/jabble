# Jabble
A Jump'n'run Scrabble Game

## Gameplay

_This is what this game should eventually look like._

A cute smart badget walks through the forest with a Scrabble board, inviting every animal it meets to play against him.
It gets points both for :

- [x] animal fellows it manages to talk into playing (+5 points);
- [x] words it places (according to the Scrabble rules);
- [x] bonuses (+1 point each);
- [x] penalties (from -2 to -15 points each).

_The points will be adjusted later._
